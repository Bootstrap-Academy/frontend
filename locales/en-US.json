All data you might have access to, need to be removed immediately(!) and completely from your systems. Data on our systems may NOT be changed! Please try to keep other user out of this, try and exploit yourselves, if it is a user based exploit. Also, please limit yourselves to the Bootstrap Academy. Everything that's not from the academy is out of scope. Example: We use Youtube videos, but we don't own Youtube, so it's out of scope. Also: Only the first reporter will be rewarded and if you are a third party provider, there will probably be no reward. Speaking of rewards: Rewards are most commonly paid out in morphcoins. The amount is defined by the severity of the bug and the quality of the report and how easy you make it for us to fix it. In cases where we discussed that you do bug hunting for us, a payout in euro is possible. Please contact us, if you want this BEFORE you search for a bug!"
